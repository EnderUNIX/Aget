EnderUNIX Aget v0.4.1 README
--------------------------

This program is a starting point for a very useful project like FlashGet
for Win32.  My aim is to provide all the functionality that program has.

If you need assistance in installing Aget, you can see INSTALL file,
Program is tested on RedHat Linux 8, FreeBSD 4.7 and
Solaris 7,8 (Sparc). It proved to be successful.

You can get much more info from the Aget Web site:
